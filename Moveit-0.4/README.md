2. [Animated success Icon](http://kodhus.com/library/moveit-demo/)



Include [`moveit.js`](moveit.js) in your project. Then in your html's body add following code:

```html
<svg width="400" height="400">
  <circle id="circle" cx="100" cy="100" r="40" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="4"></circle>
</svg>
```

Now in javascript add following code. It first set the initial size of the circle path and then animates it.
```javascript
Moveit.put(circle, {
  start: '0%',
  end: '14%'
});
Moveit.animate(circle, {
  start: '0%',
  end: '100%',
  duration: 0.6,
  delay: 0,
  timing: 'ease-out'
});
```

## Usage
> Setting Start and end of the visible portion of the full svg path:

```
Moveit.put('YOUR SVG PATH', {
  start: 'start perentage of the path%',
  end: 'end percentage of the path%',
  duration: [Duration in second(s)],
  timing: 'ease-in' | 'ease-out' | 'ease-in-out' | 'cubic-bezier'
});
```
> Animating SVG path:

```
Moveit.put('YOUR SVG PATH', {
  start: '0%',
  end: '14%'
});
```

## Frequently Asked Questions
* Can I use external javascript aimation libraries to use different timing functions such as Elasticity, etc?
  * Due to performace, we avoided implementing this. At the moment we only support css timing functions including ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier.
